# Summary
	12/6/2023:
		For our server side of the Snake Client we implemented two new classes, GameServer 
		which handles all of the data and running the server, and Client which handles all 
		of the data received from the client.  In addition we modified aspects of the model, 
		such as having collision checkers to make the server code more readable. We did not
		encounter any bugs, or troubles throughout the assignment. Our special game mode 
		features translating powerups that will float around the world in random directions.
